This repository contains the source code of a twitter analysis solution. It consists of using a graph-oriented database to design and build a tweet's analysis solution. Its main functionalities are:
  - Collect data from Tweets 
  - Analyze and process the data using a graph-oriented database
  - View/visualize the results

## Project implementation steps

## Data Model
Once the data has been collected, we obtain a JSON format file that must be used to generate the graph associated with the research.
The diagram below represents the model that was defined in order to perform this task:
